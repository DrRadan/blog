<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_nm5a0kCyu11teyfqto1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>Our second R&amp;D Report, <i>Probabilistic Methods for Realtime Streams</i>, has gone out! In this report, we explored probabilistic algorithms for machine learning on potentially large realtime streams of data with efficient CPU and memory usage.</p><p>Our prototype demonstrated these algorithms running on large amounts of social conversation data. More on that soon.</p>
