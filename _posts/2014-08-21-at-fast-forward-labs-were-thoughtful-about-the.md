We decided that we preferred a shared large table instead of individual desks, to make it easier to collaborate and offer the flexibility to spread out when necessary, and to allow space for other people to drop in and work with us.</p>
<p>We also love to build things, and find an hour of working with our hands to be a welcome respite from hours of math, programming, reading, and writing, so we decided to build it ourselves!</p>
<p>Our table construction project was designed and led by <a href="https://twitter.com/mynameisfiber">Micha</a>, and it came out beautifully. The photos here document the design and build process.</p>
