<p>This week, we had the pleasure of hosting an online talk with the team from <a href="http://www.agolo.com">Agolo</a>, an NYC-based startup with a great product that automatically summarizes articles (and can even generate new titles for a group of summarized articles). </p><p>During the event, we discussed:</p><ul><li>why summarization has suddenly become interesting<br/></li><li>how different industries are applying the technology</li><li>how algorithms work (LDA, word2vec, and recurrent neural networks)</li><li>related applications (realtime translation, speech recognition)</li><li>what’s next in the field</li></ul><p>Check out the recording below!</p><p>If you’re interested in this topic, our <i>Summarization </i>report explores the technical details discussed during the event in much greater depth. The report explains the algorithms we used to build <a href="http://www.fastforwardlabs.com/brief/">Brief</a>, a prototype that summarizes articles.
